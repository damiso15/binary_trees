**Note**: For tasks 0 to 23 (included), you have to deal with simple binary trees. They are not BSTs, thus they don’t follow any kind of rule.


## Print function ##
To match the examples in the tasks, you are given [this function](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x1C.c/blob/master/binary_trees.h)

This function is used only for visualization purposes. You don’t have to push it to your repo. It may not be used during the correction


## 0. New node ##
Write a function that creates a binary tree node

* Prototype: `binary_tree_t *binary_tree_node(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);`
* Where `parent` is a pointer to the parent node of the node to create
* And `value` is the value to put in the new node
* When created, a node does not have any child
* Your function must return a pointer to the new node, or `NULL` on failure

## 1. Insert left ##
Write a function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node

* Prototype: `binary_tree_t *binary_tree_insert_left(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);`
* Where `parent` is a pointer to the node to insert the left-child in
* And `value` is the value to store in the new node
* Your function must return a pointer to the created node, or `NULL` on failure or if `parent` is `NULL`
* If `parent` already has a left-child, the new node must take its place, and the old left-child must be set as the left-child of the new node.

## 2. Insert right ##
Write a function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node

* Prototype: `binary_tree_t *binary_tree_insert_right(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);`
* Where `parent` is a pointer to the node to insert the right-child in
* And `value` is the value to store in the new node
* Your function must return a pointer to the created node, or `NULL` on failure or if `parent` is `NULL`
* If `parent` already has a right-child, the new node must take its place, and the old right-child must be set as the right-child of the new node.

## 3. Delete ##
Write a function that deletes an entire binary tree

* Prototype: `void binary_tree_delete(binary_tree_t *tree);`
* Where `tree` is a pointer to the root node of the tree to delete
* If `tree` is `NULL`, do nothing

## 4. Is leaf ##
Write a function that checks if a node is a leaf

* Prototype: `int binary_tree_is_leaf(const binary_tree_t *node);`
* Where `node` is a pointer to the node to check
* Your function must return `1` if `node` is a leaf, otherwise `0`
